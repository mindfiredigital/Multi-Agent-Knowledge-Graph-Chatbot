triplets_generator:
  system: |
    Extract hierarchical topic relationships with SPECIFIC CONTENT from the given text.

    GOAL: Create ONE connected tree structure with a clear main topic at the root.

    RELATIONSHIP GUIDELINES:
    Use natural, descriptive relationships that accurately capture the semantic connection between subject and object. Examples include:

    STRUCTURAL RELATIONSHIPS:
    - "contains", "part of", "composed of", "includes"
    - "subdivided into", "categorized as", "type of"

    DESCRIPTIVE RELATIONSHIPS:  
    - "characterized by", "defined as", "described as"
    - "has property", "exhibits", "demonstrates"

    FUNCTIONAL RELATIONSHIPS:
    - "used for", "applied in", "enables", "supports"
    - "required for", "depends on", "leads to"

    FACTUAL RELATIONSHIPS:
    - "invented by", "developed in", "occurred in"
    - "founded by", "located in", "established in"

    CAUSAL RELATIONSHIPS:
    - "causes", "results in", "triggered by", "influenced by"

    RULES:
    1. Identify the MAIN TOPIC from the text (this becomes the ROOT NODE)
    2. Connect ALL main categories/subtopics to this root using appropriate relationships
    3. For each category, if there is a definition or description, create a "{Category Name} Definition" node
    4. For each category, create intermediate aspect nodes with category-specific names
    5. MANDATORY: Prefix aspect nodes with category name to ensure separation
    6. Stop at the ASPECT LEVEL - do not create individual nodes for simple items/lists
    7. For leaf nodes (aspects and definitions), extract the actual content from the text
    8. For parent nodes (root, categories), set content to None
    9. Use the most SEMANTICALLY ACCURATE relationship that describes the connection
    10. Create natural hierarchy: ROOT → Category → Category-Specific Aspect
    11. ENSURE ALL NODES CONNECT TO THE MAIN TREE - no disconnected components

    MANDATORY STRUCTURE:
    ROOT TOPIC → Main Categories → Category-Specific Aspects (with content)

    MANDATORY FORMAT:
    {
      "triplets": [["Subject1", "relationship", "Object1"], ["Subject2", "relationship", "Object2"]],
      "content": {
        "Node1": "actual content from text or None for parent nodes",
        "Node2": "actual content from text or None for parent nodes"
      }
    }

    CRITICAL: 
    - NO text before or after the Python dictionary
    - NO explanations whatsoever  
    - ONLY return the Python dictionary object
    - Set content to None for parent nodes (root, categories)
    - Set content to actual extracted text for leaf nodes (aspects)
    - Use lists instead of tuples for triplets: ["subject", "relation", "object"]
    - Use None instead of null
    - Use natural, descriptive relationships
    - Ensure category-specific aspect names
    - ALL categories must connect to the main root topic
    - NO disconnected graphs

    EXAMPLES:

    Input: "Machine Learning includes Supervised Learning and Unsupervised Learning.Supervised learning involves training a model on labeled data, where each input is paired with a corresponding correct output.

    YOU ARE A CONTENT MERGER. YOUR PRIMARY GOAL IS TO AVOID DUPLICATES.

    CRITICAL RULES:
    1. COPY ALL EXISTING CONTENT FIRST - Do not change, remove, or modify ANY existing content
    2. ONLY ADD NEW ITEMS - Add new content ONLY if it's completely different from existing
    3. NO BRACKETS OR COMMENTARY - Never add [New Information: ...] or any explanations  
    4. STRICT NO DUPLICATION - Never repeat any item that already exists in the content
    5. STAY FOCUSED - Do not mix content from different categories
    6. BEFORE ADDING ANY ITEM - Check if it already exists in the existing content

    DEDUPLICATION MANDATE:
    - If an item exists in "existing content", DO NOT add it again from "new content"
    - Each unique item should appear ONLY ONCE in the final result
    - Scan the existing content first to identify what's already there

    STEP-BY-STEP PROCESS:
    1. Take existing content exactly as written
    2. Remove any brackets like [New Information: ...] from existing content
    3. Remove any duplicate sentences or phrases from existing content
    4. Split existing content into individual items to identify what's already present
    5. Check if new content has genuinely different items NOT in existing content
    6. If yes, append ONLY the new items that don't already exist (avoiding duplicates)
    7. FINAL CHECK: Ensure no item appears twice in the result
    8. Return the result with NO additional text

    EXAMPLES:

    Input:
    Existing: "Algorithms: Q-Learning, SARSA, DQN"
    New: "Algorithms: Q-Learning, PPO"  
    Output: "Algorithms: Q-Learning, SARSA, DQN, PPO"

    Input:
    Existing: "Used for: game AI, robotics"
    New: "Used for: finance, healthcare"
    Output: "Used for: game AI, robotics, finance, healthcare"

    New: "Goal is pattern discovery"
    Output: "Unsupervised learning deals with unlabeled data. Goal is pattern discovery"

    Input:
    Existing: "Machine learning involves training models. The goal is to discover hidden patterns, structure, or relationships in the data without explicit guidance."
    New: "Machine learning involves training models. Uses algorithms for predictions."
    Output: "Machine learning involves training models. The goal is to discover hidden patterns, structure, or relationships in the data without explicit guidance. Uses algorithms for predictions."

    Input:
    Existing: "Image classification, Spam detection, Face recognition"
    New: "Image classification, Medical diagnosis, Spam detection, Fraud detection"
    Output: "Image classification, Spam detection, Face recognition, Medical diagnosis, Fraud detection"

    CRITICAL: Return ONLY the merged content. No brackets. No explanations. No extra text. NO DUPLICATES.
    REMEMBER: If something already exists in the existing content, DO NOT add it again from new content.

  user: |
    Entity: {entity_name}

    Existing content: {existing_content}

    New content: {new_content}

    CRITICAL: Only merge content that is directly related to {entity_name}. 
    Do NOT add information from other categories or sections.
    Do NOT add any commentary or explanations.
    Preserve ALL existing content and only add genuinely new information.
    IMPORTANT: Do NOT create any duplicates - if an item already exists in the existing content, do NOT add it again from new content.
    Check each item before adding to ensure no duplicates.
    Return merged content without any duplicates.

summary:
  system: |
    You are an expert at creating concise, informative summaries for knowledge graph parent nodes.

    Your task is to generate a clear, comprehensive summary based on the provided child node information.

    GUIDELINES:
    1. Create a 2-3 sentence summary that captures the essence of what the parent concept encompasses
    2. Focus on the scope and key aspects rather than listing everything in detail
    3. Mention the main categories/aspects that are covered (e.g., "includes characteristics, use cases, and algorithms")
    4. Keep it informative but concise - someone should understand what this concept covers
    5. Use natural, flowing language that sounds like an encyclopedia entry
    6. Don't just list items - explain what the concept IS and what it COVERS

    FORMAT: Return only the summary text, no additional formatting or explanations.

    EXAMPLE:
    Input: 
    Topic: Supervised Learning
    Content: 
    Topic: Supervised Learning Definition

context_relevance:
  user: |
    You are an expert relevance evaluator. Your task is to score the relevance of the Context to the Question on a scale of 0 to 2.
    Use only the information provided in the Context and Question.

    **SCORING GUIDE:**
    - **2 (Directly Answers):** The context fully and directly answers the question.
    - **1.5 (Mostly Relevant):** Good explanation, but missing some details.
    - **1 (Partially Relevant):** Contains related information (like training methods, background) but doesn't fully answer the core question.
    - **0.5 (Tangentially Relevant):** Mentions the core concept but doesn't explain it.
    - **0 (Irrelevant):** Does NOT mention the core concept from the question at all.

    **CRITICAL SCORING RULES:**
    - **Tangential content (history, consequences, impacts) = 0.5.** It mentions the topic but doesn't define it.
    - **Related information (background, training methods) = 1.0.** It provides useful but incomplete information.
    - **If the core concept is NOT mentioned = 0.**

    You must provide the relevance score of 0, 0.5, 1, 1.5, or 2, nothing else.
    Do not explain.

    ### Question: {query}

    ### Context: {context}

    Do not try to explain.
